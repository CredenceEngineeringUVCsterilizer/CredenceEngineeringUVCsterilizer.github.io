					<h3>1.How does UV-C Disinfection work?</h3>
						<div>
							<p>UV Disinfection is used to kill or inactive micro-organisms through a physical process. It is a quick, and effective approach to
							   kill viruses and other micro-organisms. In this process, micro-organisms are exposed to germicidal wavelengths of Ultraviolet Light so, they are rendered incapable of making their copies, and infecting. </P>
							<p>The UV-C Disinfection approach is very effective to fight against coronavirus as well.</p>
							<p>UV Light is also capable to fight against those pathogenic organisms who are responsible for generating viral diseases such as cholera, polio, typhoid, and other parasitic diseases.
							  Additionally, UV light is also capable to destroy chemical pollutants such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and so on through the UV-oxidation process.
							   UV Disinfection cannot leave any chemical residue, as it is a non-chemical process.</p>
						</div>
					
						<h3>2.What is UV-C Disinfection Cabinet?</h3>
						<div>
							<p>
								UV (Ultraviolet Spectrum) is an effective disinfectant for most viruses and micro-organisms. Generally, UV cabinets are used for Chromatographic analysis by Ultraviolet Fluorescence. 
								These cabinets are useful for observing Chromatogram by combining both short and longwave Ultraviolet Lights as well as White Light.
							</p>
						</div>
						
						<h3>3.What is Ultra Violet (UV) Light?</h3>
						<div>
							<p>
								Ultra Violet Light is invisible to the human eye, but it is very effective to kill bacteria, germs, viruses, and other micro-organisms. 
								It resides between X-Rays and Visible Light in an electromagnetic spectrum. 
							</p>
							<p>
								A distinctive characteristic of UV Light is that a particular range of its wavelength (between 200 and 300 nm) are classified as germicidal. 
								It means that it has the capability to kill microorganisms such as viruses, bacteria and so on.
							</p>
						</div>
						<h3>4.How effective is Ultraviolet light in denaturing Coronavirus?</h3>
						<div>
							<p>The UV radiation can be classified into three types according to their wavelength (UVA, UVB and UVC). These UV wavelengths differ in their biological activity and the extent to which they penetrate inside cells and microorganisms.</p>
							
							<p>Out of these three, UVC has the highest disinfectant capacity because of its shorter wavelength and ability of this wavelength to interact with the RNA and DNA of the cells and microbes [1]. 
							COVID -19 is from the coronavirus family and resembles SARS virus that was identified in 2002. Both these viruses attack primarily the respiratory system by rapidly multiplying itself inside the cells of human respiratory tract. 
							To replicate itself these virus inserts its genetic instructions (RNA or DNA ) into the human cells which then reads the instructions and makes multiple copies of itself.</p>
						</div>
						<h3>5.How long does it take to be effective?</h3>
						<div>
						<p>The effectiveness of germicidal UV depends on the length of time a microorganism is exposed to UV, the intensity and wavelength of the UV radiation and other factors? 
						   In general, 5 minutes should be more than sufficient exposure to kill 99% of germs, bacteria and viruses according to multiple sources.</p>
						</div>
												
						<h3>6.Do germicidal lamps kill viruses?</h3>
						<div>
							<p>Yes -germicidal UV-C lamps kill up to 99% of most viruses, airborne bacteria and mold spores.</p>
						</div>
						
						<h3>7.Is UV light Safe?</h3>
						<div>
							<p>Prolonged, direct exposure to UV-C light can cause temporary skin redness and eye irritation. We suggest keeping the door of the cabinet closed to avoid direct contact.</p>
						</div>
						
						<h3>8.Can UV light penetrate surfaces?</h3>
						<div>
							<p>Germicidal UV-C light only sterilizes what it comes into contact with. We recommend placing items so they are directly exposed to the light.</p>
						</div>
						
						<h3>9.What does UV light disinfect?</h3>
						<div>
							<p>UV-C light will disinfect most surfaces it comes into contact with Phones, toothbrushes, baby bottles and face masks (FFRs) are just a few items,
   							  where Germicidal UV-C light has been considered to be safe and effective.</p>
